PancakeSwapSmartRouter in a Foundry project.


## Getting Started

This is a downloadable replica of the PancakeSwapSmartRouter contracts, found on-chain here on [BSC](https://bscscan.com/address/0xc6665d98efd81f47b03801187eb46cbc63f328b0#code).

I wanted to see what it looked like locally, and the Pancake people haven't released any repositories yet, so I *painstakingly* copied the code from bscscan and put it into a Foundry project for easy perusal.

Only changes thus far have been applying `forge fmt` to the codebase for readability.

If this is your first time using Foundry, check out the
[installation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) instructions.
